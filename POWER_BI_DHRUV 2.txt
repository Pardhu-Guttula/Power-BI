	- Power Pivot
	- Power View
	- Power Map
	- Power BI SERVICE

- Power Query:
	- data cleaning

- Power Pivot:
	- brain
 	- Model data
	- SET up relationships
	- create measures
	- Set KPI

- Power View:

- Distinct: Counting each value once
  Unique: Counting non-repetetive values only

- Healthy business: stagnant unique count and a growing distinct count denotes healthy business

- Filter -- EQUALS

- Contains - 'IN'in SQL
  Equals - is equal to

- Filterd Rows:
  Select Column > Arrow >Text Filter > Equals > give paramter

- Merge Queries:
  Select Column > Home > Merge queries

- Granualarity - lowest level of data

- Name of customers who returned:
	- Go to Returns and then merge queries
	- Select common table and merge tables
	- We can see duplicates in cutomernames
	- Remove duplicates by Column Name > Right click > Remove duplicates

- Extract year from order id:
	- Column > Transform > Extract> between delimeiters ----but it will change the column, so
	- Now, use add column to solve this issue
	- Column > Add Column > Extract > Text btw delimiters > Give delimiters > Rename > chaneg datatype to whole number 

- Extract after year from order id:
	- Column > Add Column > Extract > Text after delimiters > Give delimiters > Advanced options > Give delimiter > ok

- Split Name to FirstName and LastName: 
	-  Column > Transform > Split column > by delimiter > space > left > ok

- Expand people table:
	- Click Person > Home > Merge queries > Expand Orders > select Customer_ID > Remove deuplicates > Rename columns 

- Replace values:
	- Click the cell > right click > replace value 

- Transform -- Add suffix:
	- Column > transform > format > add suffix 

- Date transformations:
	- Column Name > Add column > Date > select 

- Clustered bar chart - gives clear perception when multiple legends are present

- 100% Stacked bar charts : micro, eg: petrol fluctuations
	- It gives us the percentage that each category contributes.
  Stacked bar charts : macro elements

- Line charts: Done in collaboration to time period

- Line charts with slicer:
	- Line chart > Create one > 
	- Add Slicer
	- Slicer > Drag and drop columns > 

- Ribbon Chart:
	- In each year which category has more sales

- Waterfall Chart: 
	- To show negative contribution

- Funnel Chart : For the purpose of percentile calculation

- Scatter Chart: only chart which has 2 axes on opposite axes

- Pie, Donot and Sunburst charts - Donot chart is superior to pie chart

- Tree Map - It's like a hierarchy, uses drilldown 

- Filter - end user can change
  Slicer - end user cant change

- Gauge - Create measures for min, max and tragte
	- Home> New Measure > Create new like 'Min = 35000'

- Card: used for creating KPI's
- KPI is like a metrics, used to measure efficiency. 

- For even formatting : Format > Align > Distribute horizontally

- After aligning cards, try to fit 4 charts, at most 6

- Multi-row card: We can use multiple columns, we can drag multiple values 

- KPI Visual: 
	- Gives kpi of most recent year, use measure, changes color based on target given
	- Trend analysis
	
- Date Hierachy is better for selecting multiple dates

- Slicer > Format > Edit interaction - it effects the behaviour of other charts or cards
	- Highlight
	- Filter
	- None

- Matrix : 
	- It's similar to pivot table
	- It's much more advanced in hierarchy than normal tables

- Advanced Visualization:
	- Tooltip: Create tooltip by changing page information > allow tooltip 
					      canvas setting > type > tooltip
	- After creating a toottip, link that to any chart
	- General > tooltips > page > select the tooltip

- Conditional Formatting:
	- Gradient
	- Rules
	- Tables


- Welcome Page:
	- ADD bg image
	- Header
	- Button, set action to buttons
	- Always use shape at the back of button 
	- Format > Send backward

- View> Bookmarks, selection-unhide and hide the data

- Drill Through:
	- Used Page Layout which is already created
	- Right bottom find for "Add drill-through fields here" > Drag and drop the required column there
	- On the pie chart, right click on any category > drill through > page name
	- If we dont want to right click, create a blank button, add action to the button
	- Action > Drill Through > Page Name
	- Always hide the drill through page, because the client shouldnot see the drill through page

- Grouping and Binning:
	- Create groups based on sub-category
	- Bins based on row id

- OLTP - Online Transaction Process => SQL
- OLAP - Online Analysis Pricess => POWER BI
- POS - Point of SALES

- Facts - anything that is quantitative

-Cross- filter direction, bidirectional cardinality
