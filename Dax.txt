Adding New column
	DayName = Format(DateTable[Date],"dd")		01
									  ddd		Mon
									  dddd		Monday
	DayName = Day(DateTable[Date])
	
	WeekNo = Weeknum(DateTable[Date], 11) 		week starts from Monday
	WeekDayNo = WeekDay(", 2)					mon-sun
	
	
How to mitigate many to many relationship
	- by using bridge table 	[ex: part-5 2:13:55]
	
Sum can do sum of sales in orders table	[ex: SumSales1 is a measure of sum(orders[sales])]
SUMX can do product of measure and normalcol [ex: Sumx(Orders, [SumSales1] * sum(Orders[quantity]))]	Summation is required

SUMX can do diff b/w measure and normalcol 	 [ex: Sumx(Orders, [SumSales1] - Orders[Discount]))			Summation is not required

for the above case normalcol can be used in measure without summation can be used only in sumx. If there is no use of sumx then that particulat column should be 
provided with summation of that column.		[This case can happen only the operator used in formula is "-"]



- If no effect should be done on column name, then we can use this formula:
	- calculate([sumsales1],all(Orders))			All columns in Orders table will not get effected
	
	
RANK:
	- RANKX(All(Orders[Sub-Category]),[SumSales1],,Desc)          By default - descending order
Dynamic Rank: [Giving Rank based on output obtained]
	- RANKX(AllSelected(Order[Sub-Category]),[SumSales1])
	
	- SelectedValue = "Any text" & SelectedValue(Orders[Sub-Category],"Nothing")
	- PrevDay = calculate([SumSales], PreviousDay(DateTable[Date]))
	- PrevDayMonth = calculate([SumSales1], DateAdd(DateTable[Date], -1, Month))
	- YTD = TotalYtd([SumSales1], DateTable[Date])			[Starting of year till current Date]
	- MTD = TotalMtd([SumSales1], DateTable[Date])			[Starting of Month till Date]
	- CummTotal = Calculate([SumSales1], Filter(All(DateTable),DateTable[Date] <= Max(DateTable[Date])))
	- CummFixedTotal = If(SelectedValue(DateTable[Date])<=[FixedDate],[CummTotal])
	- Spyl = calculate([sumsales1], SamePeriodLastYear(DateTable[Date]))
